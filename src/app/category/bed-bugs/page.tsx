          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Bed bugs are small, reddish-brown insects, approximately the size of an apple seed. Their bodies swell and darken after feeding on blood. Nymphs (young bed bugs) are nearly transparent until they feed, while their eggs are tiny and pearly white.
            <br /><br />
            These pests usually stay within 8 feet of sleeping areas, hiding in mattress seams, box springs, bed frames, and crevices. They are most active from midnight to early morning and feed solely on blood, using anesthetic saliva to avoid detection.
            <br /><br />
            Increased travel has made bed bugs more common, as they easily hitchhike on luggage and clothing. Although they arenâ€™t known to spread disease, their bites can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, and anxiety. Professional treatment is often required due to their ability to hide and survive without feeding for long periods.
