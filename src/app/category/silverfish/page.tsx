          Silverfish are tiny, wingless insects known for their silvery color and swift, fish-like movements. They are commonly found in damp, dark areas of the home.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Why Silverfish Are a Concern</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Silverfish are typically 1/2 to 3/4 inches long, flat, and tapered like a carrot, with three tail-like projections at the rear and long antennae at the front. They prefer dark, damp areas like bathrooms, basements, attics, kitchens, and laundry rooms where they remain hidden during the day and become active at night.
            <br /><br />
            As herbivores, silverfish feed on carbohydrates and protein-rich items including paper, book bindings, wallpaper, glue, cardboard, and textiles. They can even consume dried foods like flour and pasta and sometimes other dead insects. Though they donâ€™t bite or spread disease, they can seriously damage books, clothes, food items, and valuable documents.
            <br /><br />
            Infestations are particularly common in humid regions of the U.S., such as the Southeast, Midwest, and coastal areas. Their presence can also trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals due to their shed scales and waste. Eliminating silverfish is essential to protect your belongings and maintain a hygienic environment.
