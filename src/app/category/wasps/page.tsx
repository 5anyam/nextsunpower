          Wasps are widespread stinging insects in the United States, easily recognizable by their long, slender bodies, narrow waists, and bold black, yellow, or reddish markings.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Why Wasps Are a Serious Concern</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Wasps are known to nest in places like porch ceilings, attic rafters, and sheds, using chewed wood and saliva to create their homes. Adults feed on nectar and sweets, while young wasps are given proteins like insects and spiders. Some wasps, including paper wasps, yellowjackets, and hornets, live in large, social colonies and become extremely aggressive when defending their nests.
            <br /><br />
            While wasps play a vital ecological role by pollinating flowers and controlling insect populations, they can become a threat due to their painful stingsâ€”especially for those allergic to them. Wasp infestations are common due to the abundance of ideal nesting spots around homes and easy access to sugary drinks, garbage, and insects.
            <br /><br />
            During long warm summers, colonies grow larger and wasps become more aggressive as they fight over food and defend nests. Unlike bees, wasps can sting multiple times and are very territorial. Professional wasp pest control services are often necessary to safely remove nests and prevent reinfestation.
