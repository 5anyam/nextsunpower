          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Ants are small yet incredibly resilient insects that live in highly organized colonies. Attracted to food, water, and shelter, they are experts in infiltration, often forming visible trails as they invade homes.
            <br /><br />
            Despite their tiny size, ants are powerfulâ€”able to lift up to 50 times their body weight. With over 12,000 known species globally, including several problematic ones in the U.S., they are a force to be reckoned with. A small infestation can escalate quickly, especially when scout ants leave pheromone trails that invite the whole colony.
            <br /><br />
            Whether you are dealing with biting fire ants or nuisance pavement ants, early detection and control are key to preventing large infestations.
