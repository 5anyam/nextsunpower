          Spiders are commonly found in American homes. Although most are harmless and help control insect populations, certain species like the black widow and brown recluse require caution due to their venomous bites.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Spiders are eight-legged arachnids known for their ability to spin silk. They come in a variety of shapes and colors depending on their species. Some spin webs to trap prey while others, like wolf and jumping spiders, actively hunt.
            <br /><br />
            They feed on insects like flies, mosquitoes, and antsâ€”helping reduce pest populations in and around homes. While most spiders are solitary and shy, a few can bite when threatened. The black widow and brown recluse are the most medically significant spiders in the U.S.
            <br /><br />
            Spider infestations are common due to favorable indoor environments, easy prey access, and ample hiding spaces. Controlling their population not only reduces potential health risks but also creates a more comfortable living space.
