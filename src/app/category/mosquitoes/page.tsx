          Mosquitoes are common pests in the U.S. known for their buzzing presence and itchy bites. While both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectar, only females bite to obtain protein for egg development.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Mosquitoes have long lower bodies, narrow upper bodies, and a single pair of wings. Female mosquitoes have specialized mouthparts to extract blood from humans and animals. These insects breed in warm, damp environments like clogged drains, stagnant ponds, and forgotten containers.
            <br /><br />
            They are most active in the mornings and evenings, although some species bite during the day. Attracted by body warmth, carbon dioxide, and sweat, mosquitoes find humans an easy target.
            <br /><br />
            Climate change, dirty surroundings, and the abundance of breeding grounds have led to an increase in mosquito infestationsâ€”and with it, the risk of disease transmission, including Zika, West Nile, dengue, and chikungunya.
